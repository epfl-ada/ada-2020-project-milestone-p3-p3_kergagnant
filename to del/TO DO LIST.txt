# Study rating's influence on mobility with respect to traveling distance <-- 3
- the x-axis: the distance travelled 
- the y-axis: the probability to travel to distance x and traveling to well rated business (i.e stars >= 3.5) 
		P(well rated|distance=d)

Create the null-model:
The null model: sample checkins with distribution of businesses on square_id's 
- the x-axis: the distance travelled 
- the y-axis: he probability to travel to distance x and traveling to well rated business (i.e stars >= 3.5)


# Study friend's ratings influence on mobility with respect to traveling distance
1. Friend recommend 
- the x-axis: the distance travelled 
- the y-axis: the probability to travel to distance d and traveling to a business recommended by a friend (i.e >= 3.5 stars)
Attention: check that friend posted review prior to travelling date 

Sur la dataframe checkins Ã  faire:
- place reviewed label: reviewed by friend before (good review >= 3.5: 2, bad review < 3.5: 1, not reviewed: 0) <-- 1
- place distance label: place label = distance to user's home <-- 2

- group by distance, and for each group card(label 2)/card(group) <-- 2

2. Friend avoid 
- the x-axis: the distance travelled 
- the y-axis: the probability to travel to distance d and traveling to a business not recommended by a friend (i.e < 3.5 stars)


# Words of mouth effect: 
Only on checkins that have been a reviewed by a friend before, study the probability to move to a well reviewed business with respect to distance 
- the x-axis: the distance travelled 
- the y-axis: the probability to travel to distance x and traveling to businesses (reviewed by a friend) and (with a rate greater or equal than 3.5)

- group by distance, and for each group card(label 2)/[card(label 2) + card(label 1)] <-- 2



Data Story: In reviews we trust!
Goal: How do ratings on businesses affect mobility?  

--> Influence of mean rating on businesses mobility? Good vs bad ratings
--> Study of the word of mouth impact: how do friend recommendations influence our mobility. How likely are we to visit a friend's recommended business?
    Depending on day of the week, or on special event (e.g Thanksgiving, Independence Day, Black Friday, Christmas ...) 
--> Study the 'treatment' having a good rating vs not, with method seen in course 
    => does a good rating has an influence on the number of visits of the business + study correlation between rating and number of visits 
--> Are there categories of businesses more influenced by reviews than others? Study the word of mouth effect on categories 
    and study the mean rating impact. 
--> Study the 'treatment' having a good rating vs not, with method seen in course => does a good rating has an influence on
